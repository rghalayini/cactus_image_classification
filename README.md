## Image classification with Pytorch

In this exercise, we try to solve the aerial cactus identification competition in Kaggle [Click here to download the data and read about the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/data?select=train.zip). We use Pytorch to create the algorithm. PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with instructions on how to proceed.
